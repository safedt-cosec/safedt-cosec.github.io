        <h1>Safe Digital Twins for the Built Environment</h1> 

        <p>This is a <a href="https://www.cosec.ac.uk/what-is-cosec/cosec-fellowship-programme/" target="_blank" >2025 CoSeC Fellowship</a> project that examines how digital twins are being developed and used across the conservation, construction, and infrastructure sectors. As these technologies become increasingly embedded in decision-making, new questions are emerging around accuracy, reliability, security, and long-term safety. <b>SafeDT</b> aims to identify these risks and consider how digital twins can be adopted responsibly and with appropriate safeguards.</p>

        <p>To support this work, the project will host an <em>Idea Factory Event</em> in collaboration with the University of Bath's <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/research-institutes/institute-for-policy-research/" target="_blank" >Institute for Policy Research (IPR)</a>. The event will bring together researchers, industry partners, and policymakers to explore shared concerns and priorities. By collaborating closely with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-and-trade" target="_blank" >Department for Business and Trade</a>, <b>SafeDT</b> will also ensure alignment with wider UK digital policy.</p>

        <p>The insights from the event will inform a <em>White Paper</em> outlining key challenges and recommendations for safe and effective digital twin deployment in the built environment. <b>SafeDT</b> ultimately seeks to encourage a broader national conversation about responsibility, uncertainty, and care as digital technologies increasingly shape how we manage and protect both historic and modern assets.</p>
