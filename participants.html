        <p>Dr Alejandro Jiménez Rios is a Civil Engineer graduated from the University of Guadalajara, Mexico. He obtained the double title of Advanced Master's Degree in the Structural Analysis of Monuments and Historical Constructions (SAHC) by the Czech Technical University, Czech Republic, and by the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Spain. At Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, he got a postgraduate diploma in statistics and also a PhD in Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering. He worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Structural and Geotechnical Engineering of the Faculty of Architecture at the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy.</p>

        <p>As part of the DTADD project, he worked as a MSCA Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Built Environment, Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway, held a distinguished ICCROM Fellowship with the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), Italy and was hosted at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, during a three-month secondment. Currently, he works as Lecturer in Structural Engineering at the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-architecture-civil-engineering/" target="_blank" ><b>Department of Architecture & Civil Engineering</b></a>, <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/homepage/" target="_blank" ><b>University of Bath</b></a>, UK.</p>

        <p>His research focuses on preserving and maintaining historic buildings and bridges. He studies traditional and eco-friendly architecture and investigate how materials like masonry, bamboo, and earth behave under different conditions. This involves using methods that don't damage the structures and conducting large-scale tests. He also works on making buildings more robust and resilient. Additionally, he explores how new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and digital twins, can be used in architecture, construction, and engineering to improve the way structures are monitored and managed.</p>
