        <h2>The SafeDT Project Has Officially Started!</h2>

        <p><b>01-10-2025</b></p>

        <p><a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/alejandro-jimenez-rios" target="_blank" ><b>Dr Alejandro Jiménez Rios</b></a> has been awarded a <a href="https://www.cosec.ac.uk/what-is-cosec/cosec-fellowship-programme/" target="_blank" ><b>2025 CoSeC Fellowship</b></a> to support the <b>SafeDT</b> project: Safe Digital Twins for the Built Environment.</p>

        <p>The project officially began on 1 October 2025 and will run until 31 December 2026. Through this Fellowship, <b>SafeDT</b> will advance the development of secure, resilient, and trustworthy digital twins for heritage and modern infrastructure, working in close collaboration with experts across the CoSeC and STFC communities.</p>

        <p>Further updates, including details of upcoming events and project outputs, will be shared on this website throughout the Fellowship period.</p>

        <h2>SafeDT Presented at the 2025 CoSeC and CIUK Conferences</h2>

        <p><b>06-12-2025</b></p>

        <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/alejandro-jimenez-rios" target="_blank" ><b>Dr Alejandro Jiménez Rios</b></a> attended both the 2025 CoSeC Conference and the 2025 CIUK Conference in Manchester, UK, as part of his CoSeC Fellowship.</p>

        <p>These events provided an excellent opportunity to engage with the UK's computational science community, explore emerging advances in cybersecurity, HPC, and software sustainability, and discuss the <b>SafeDT</b> project's focus on the safe and responsible deployment of digital twins for the built environment.</p>

        <p>Insights gained during the conferences will directly inform ongoing <b>SafeDT</b> activities and future collaborations with CoSeC and STFC UKRI partners. Further updates will be shared as the project progresses.</p>
